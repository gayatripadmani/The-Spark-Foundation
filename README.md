### Task 1 : Prediction using Supervised ML

● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Task 2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

● Use R or Python or perform this task

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

### Task 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

● You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)

### Task 6 : Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis

● Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines

● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)

● Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com

● Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6
